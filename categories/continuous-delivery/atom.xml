    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk at the London Continuous Delivery meet-up about a recent client project involving the rescue of a UI application build that a previous team had failed to make much progress with. The rest of the system was built on an old-fashioned, heavyweight, big-vendor SOA stack, and although the development process was ostensibly Scrum, we found that in practice it lacked many of the attributes necessary for effective agile delivery.</p>

<p>In the talk I summarised the challenges we faced the techniques we used to isolate ourselves from dependencies, manage quality and integration risk, and deliver working code in regular, small iterations.</p>
